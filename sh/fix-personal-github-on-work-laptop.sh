#!/bin/sh

# This script searches for all Git repositories under the current directory
# and updates the remote URL for repositories that use GitHub.
# Specifically, it:
#   1. Finds all .git directories recursively
#   2. For each repository that has a GitHub remote URL:
#   3. Replaces 'github.com' with 'github-jonfk' in the origin URL
#   4. This effectively redirects all GitHub repositories to use an alternate
#      GitHub domain or mirror (github-jonfk)
# 
# Purpose:
#   This script addresses an SSH authentication issue when using multiple GitHub accounts.
#   The problem occurs because ssh-agent overrides Git's directory-based identity configuration.
#   Even though Git identities are properly separated by directories, ssh-agent ignores this
#   and selects SSH keys based solely on the hostname in the remote URL (github.com).
#   This causes personal repositories to incorrectly authenticate with a work account.
#   By changing URLs to use 'github-jonfk', repositories will match the correct host entry
#   in the SSH config, forcing ssh-agent to use the intended SSH key.
